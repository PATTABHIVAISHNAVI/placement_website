<h3 id="C1">GATE EXAM</h3>
<p>
Many students dream is to get into IIT's and NIT's .There is still an option to get into these dream colleges i.e, by writing the 
GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) exam. This exam is written by the students who are willing to pursue MTECH in thier streams. Gate exam is 
generally conducted every year by IIT's.

<br>
Along with the GRE exam there is another exam to be written i.e, IELTS and TOEFL . Anyone exam is written but the GRE is compulsary one.
<br>
<a href="https://www.ielts.org/" target="_blank">IELTS official website</a>
<br>
<a href="https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrKCcNpduJjg.sVZ8S7HAx.;_ylu=Y29sbwNzZzMEcG9zAzEEdnRpZAMEc2VjA3Ny/RV=2/RE=1675814633/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2ftoefltest.in%2f/RK=2/RS=GfqomDapT.4dHVle29ubF2M68rQ-" target="_blank">TOEFL official website</a>
<br>
Anyone of these two is written. But the GRE paper is must to write and get the entry for the desired college. Most often the engineering streams are
only choosed for the higher studies also i.e, if you have done your graduation in Electrical stream then we can go for the electrical field branch but not completely
Computer science branch. Orelse we even sometimes get an opportunity to choose the branch which is common to both the branches. If we want to try for the 
Other stream branches we need to go for the different certifications in it i.e, Minor degree courses , Online certifications etc.
